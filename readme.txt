= Plugin features =

On one image you can have two watermarks! One of them can be text watermark and the other image watermark. You can control their position and size and apply them to your media independently.

* Image watermark can be a JPG, PNG or GIF
* Full support for transparency and alpha chanel in PNG and GIF files
* JPG and GIF files and text can have opacity set (from 0 to 100%)
* Text watermark is created using ttf fonts
* Text color, size and rotation can be set
* All built-in image sizes can be watermarked (thumbnail, medium, large and fullsize) as well as all additional sizes registered by themes or plugins
* Plugin can create image backups and allows to easily restore images

= Image watermark =

Easy Watermark supports three most popular image formats for watermark: JPG, PNG and GIF. For JPG watermarks you can control the opacity as well.

Watermark can be applied in on of the 9 positions on the image and you can controll the exact sizing of it.

= Text watermark =

Text watermark have a powerful feature of placeholders, which can be dynamically applied to the image. Ie. you can put the name of user who uploaded the image as well as the upload date. Watermark text will be automatically generated and applied.

The plugin supports a few fonts:

* Arial
* Arial Black
* Comic Sans MS
* Courier New
* Georgia
* Impact
* Tahoma
* Times New Roman
* Trebuchet MS
* Verdana

You can also place the text watermark in one of the 9 positions on the image, control the angle, color, opacity and size.

== Installation ==

Note: Easy Watermark requires GD extension installed and enabled on a server to work.

1. Install via Plugin installation screen in WordPress dashboard or download and unpack plugin zip and upload its content to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Plugin is working. Go to "Tools > Easy Watermark" to set up your watermarks.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Can I remove watermark after it was added? =
Yes, since version 0.6.0 there is an option to "remove" watermark by restoring the original image. Backup feature is enabled by default, you can disable it on the "Tools > Easy Watermark" screen. Note: this will use more space on your server due to the fact that the images will be stored twice.
Only the fullsize image is stored in backup, thumbnails are regenerated during the restoring process.
To restore the original image just go to the attachment edit page. In the "Easy Watermark" meta box you can find the "Restore original image" button. You can also do this via Media page and bulk actions.

= How can I restore original images after the plugin was uninstalled? =
The plugin doesn't restore your images on deactivation/removal. Please consider to install the plugin again and restore your images before uninstalling.
If you don't have a possibility to do this, you can manually restore your images. Just go to wp-content/ew-backup in your wordpress main directory. You will se there are folders in the same order like in uploads, images are stored as /year/month/imagename.jpg|png. What you need is to copy all the files from ew-backup to uploads dir (it will ask you if you want to override the existing files, click YES). As mensioned before, this will restore only the fullsize images so you need to use some other plugin to generate the thumbnails again (see Force Regenerate Thumbnails by Pedro Elsner).

= How can I add watermark to pictures that were uploaded before the plugin was installed? =
You can go to "Tools > Easy Watermark > Tools" screen and use bulk action options.

= How can I adjust watermark image position? =
Watermark position can be adjusted vertically and horizontally by selecting alignment (left, center, right, top, middle, bottom). You can also define horizontal and vertical offset.

= Can I add both, text and image watermark at once? =
Yes, there is a posibility to add only image, only text or both.

= How Can I adjust text watermark? =
You can choose text font from the list of ten fonts included to this plugin. You can also set font size, color, angle and opacity. Position of text watermark can be adjusted exactly like the image watermark position.

= Can I use my font for text watermark? =
Unfortunately no. In PRO version you'll be able to use more fonts.

= How the scaling of the watermark image works? =
On the watermark image settings page you can se 'Scaling Mode' selection which has 5 options:
* 'None' - watermark scaling is off
* 'Fill' - watermark will fill the entire image
* 'Fit' - watermark width or height will be adjusted to image width or height in such a way that it will be all visible
* 'Fit to Width' - watermark width will always be adjusted to image width
* 'Fit to Height' - watermark height will always be adjusted to image height
If 'Scale to Smaller' checkbox is checked, any scaling will be done only for images smaller than watermark image.
Watermark ratio is always preserved, so it can go beyond the image when the 'Scaling Mode' is set to 'Fill'.
With 'Fit to Width' or 'Fit to Height' options watermark dimensions can be set as a percentage in relation to the image dimensions.

= What placeholders can I use in text watermark? =
All available placeholders are listed in a box titled 'Placeholders' displayed while creating the Text Watermark.
